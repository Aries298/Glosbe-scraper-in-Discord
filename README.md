# Glosbe-scraper-in-Discord
Tool to create tables of translated words and send them on Discord

I use it to compare words in various languages and compare them with Japanese to find possible cognates.

The syntax of the command is:
+scrapeglosbe <langgroups> <phrase in English>
 Where langgroups are:
  r - Turkic
  u - Uralic
  t - Tungusic
  s - the Rest
  
  So for example if you want to translate "water" to Uralic and Turkic language, you use:
  +scrapeglosbe ru water
